# JointParameterEstimation
Routines used to jointly estimate orbital and planetary parameters for an exoplanet with radial velocity and transit observations. As well as jointly using multiple photometric observations to estimate the rotational period of the host star. These observations include out-of-transit TESS photometric observations - which is realtively high cadence but short duration monitoring, and ASAS-SN photometric observations - which have lower cadence and precision, but are a conglomeration of data spanning years. The joint probably distributions are sampled using Juliet [https://github.com/nespinoza/juliet](url)

This routine was implemented and utilized in McGruder et. al. 2022 (ADS link: [https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...944L..56M/abstract](url))

Required packages (excluding anaconda standard packages):
1) lightkurve - [https://docs.lightkurve.org/](url)
2) uncertainties - [https://pypi.org/project/uncertainties/](url)
3) juliet - [https://github.com/nespinoza/juliet](url)
4) corner - [https://github.com/dfm/corner.py](url)


Scipts: 
1) utils.py - Internal module that stores routines that are needed for both 'Juliet_JointFit.py' and 'Photo_RunningJuliet2.py'
2) Juliet_JointFit.py - script used to estimate the system parameters which are the planetary orbital period, stellar mass, RV semi-major amplitude, inclination, planetary radius (relative to stellar radius), Radius of star, semi-major axis of planetary orbit, transit impact parameter, stellar density, and mass of planet.
3) Photo_RunningJuliet2.py - script used to estimate the host star's rotation period utilizing the multiple different photometric data.

This routine was used for many transiting systems, but for an example, the data and outputs are for the star WASP-6 and it's known transiting hot jupiter. 

Input data - Juliet_JointFit.py:
1) "W6_fullRV_sysCorr_noRM.dat" RV data, with the exclusion of the RV data when the planet transits the planet, since the code can not yet properly model the Rossiterâ€“McLaughlin effect.
2) "W6_TESS.npy" is the TESS data coming from the TESS reduction pipeline.
3) Additional inputs must be written in the code directly, in the section titled "Target input info," for specific settings desired.

Output - Juliet_JointFit.py: 
1) "W6_jointfit_fixE" (the output folder name is specified in the script "Target input info") is a folder containing the posterior samples and results, Corner plots, best fit RV and transit models overplotted on their corresponding datasets. 
2) The system parameters, which are printed out by script
